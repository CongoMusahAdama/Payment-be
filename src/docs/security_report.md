# Security Report

## Security Measures Implemented
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials are stored in environment variables using the `dotenv` package.
- **Input Validation**: User inputs are validated using the `joi` library to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Rate Limiting**: The `express-rate-limit` middleware is used to limit the number of requests to the API, mitigating the risk of denial-of-service attacks.
- **Helmet**: The `helmet` middleware is implemented to set various HTTP headers for security, helping to protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **Data Encryption**: Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` to ensure that sensitive user data is stored securely.

## Potential Areas for Enhancement
- **Implement HTTPS**: Ensure that the application is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to their latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Implement more comprehensive logging of security-related events to facilitate monitoring and incident response.

This report outlines the current security measures and suggests areas for further enhancement to ensure the application remains secure.
